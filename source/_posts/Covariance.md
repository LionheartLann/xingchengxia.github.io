# Covariance

这两天正在看《实用多元统计分析》复习一些基本的概念。第一章讲到协方差矩阵，翻译的水平真的不怎么样，解释很难懂，wiki一下，英文的定义简洁明了：

In probability theory and statistics, covariance is a measure of **the joint variability of two random variables.**[1] If the greater values of one variable mainly correspond with the greater values of the other variable, and the same holds for the lesser values, i.e., the variables tend to show similar behavior, the covariance is positive.[2] In the opposite case, when the greater values of one variable mainly correspond to the lesser values of the other, i.e., the variables tend to show opposite behavior, the covariance is negative. **The sign of the covariance therefore shows the tendency in the linear relationship between the variables.** The magnitude of the covariance is not easy to interpret. The normalized version of the covariance, the correlation coefficient, however, shows by its magnitude the strength of the linear relation.
